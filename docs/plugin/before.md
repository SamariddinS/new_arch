## Vision

Provide a co-creation platform; say goodbye to tightly coupled integrations and enable hot‑swappable features.

We do not provide a plugin management dashboard. Plugins are showcased and navigated in the [Plugin Market](../market.md).

## Development

See [Plugin Development](dev.md).

## Is it paid?

Depends on the plugin author.

## Is source code provided?

Depends on the plugin author.

## Can I use it commercially?

Depends on the plugin author.

## Support

Contact the plugin author directly.

## Disclaimer

- We are not responsible for any loss caused by malicious plugins.
- We are not responsible for paid plugin authors disappearing.
