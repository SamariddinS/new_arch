title: SSO
---

SSO (Single Sign-On) is an authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple related systems or applications with a single login, eliminating the need to repeatedly enter credentials.

**Advantages:**

- Enhances user experience by reducing login frequency
- Simplifies enterprise identity management and unifies permission control
- Strengthens security through multi-factor authentication, reducing password leakage risks

**Applicable Scenarios:** Internal enterprise systems, cloud services, cross-platform applications, etc.

## Integration

We will implement SSO integration through [casdoor](https://casdoor.org/) and release it as an [SSO plugin](../../market.md).

For implementation details and further usage guidance, please refer to the official casdoor documentation.
